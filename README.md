# Overview

This project is just a simple overview of what I can do in C#. An example of a library that contains books, you can
view all the books in the library and their availability.

# Development Environment

I used C#, .Net, VSCode and git hub for this project.

# Useful Websites

- [Microsoft DotNet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

# Future Work

- I'd love to make it so you save changes to the library and have it save like with the checking out and in status.
- Make it so that those with credentials can add books to the library.
- Maybe adding a sorting option and including genres.
